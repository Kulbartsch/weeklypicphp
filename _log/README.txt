The user-file is named "user.txt" by default.
The format is as follows:

# Empty line are ignored.
# Lines starting with a # are ignored.
# All other lines describe a user.
# A user entry might consist of one or more fields, separated by an ;
# The first field is the Slack-ID.
# The second field is the name the user is called by the App.
# More fields are ignored for now.
